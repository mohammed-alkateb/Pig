   The player can choose whether to roll the die
   or hold as long as they don't get a 1.</p>

	<h3>Usage</h3>
	<p>To play the Pig dice game, run the following code:</p>
	<pre><code>python pig_dice.py</code></pre>

	<h3>Example Code</h3>
	<p>Here is an example of the Pig dice game code:</p>
	<pre><code>def match_loop(self, player_action: int, dice_hand: Dice_hand,
                   player_index: int, histogram: Histogram) -> None:

        player = self.players[player_index]
        action = int(player_action)
        if action == 1:
            self.check_cast(histogram, player_index, dice_hand)
        elif action == 2:
            print(f"{player.name}'s score: {player.get_score()}\n")
            self.end_turn(dice_hand)
        elif action == 3:
            while True:
                new_name = input("Enter the new name: ")
                if new_name.isalpha():
                    self.update_player_info(True, player.name,
                                            new_name.lower(),
                                            None, None)
                    break
                else:
                    self.ui.only_alphabet_exception()
            player.name = new_name
        elif action == 4:
            histogram.display()
        elif action == 5:
            self.restart_match()
        elif action == 000:
            self.ui.display_admin_access()
            self.admin_access(player, player_index)
        elif action == 6:
            sys.exit()
	</code></pre>
